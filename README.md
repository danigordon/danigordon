- 👋 Hi, I’m Dani.
- 👀 I’m interested in research on environmental health and racial and socioeconomic inequities in health. I also have interests in anything nerdy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Git and re-learning how to code in R. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything, as long as I can gain some experience.
- 📫 I can be reached at danimgordon@gmail.com.
